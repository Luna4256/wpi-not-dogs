# Exposing WPI

#### Before we begin im gonna be honest i aswell did something i really regret doing.

So its starts on Febuary 16th 2022, i got a dm from Cchris the owner of Waddle Penguin Island (Will be refered to WPI).
He asked me to remove newcpi website for reasons, as soon as i removed the site i check back to the newcpi discord server and saw 1k+ pings and all the channels were gone.

I asked to cchris how my server got nuked he just said it wasnt him, well i trusted him with that. A big mistake.
ANYWAY

Around June 28th-July 1st NewCPI changed its name to Waddle Legacy and since the name change staff and members of WPI in their discord started "joking" about how the name look [similar](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1009084161098788876/1009084267629903912/unknown.png).

> Mhm a little laugh, they where sending hatefull messages

July 2nd 2022 comes around and i get another dm from Cchris saying the raid that was done in the Waddle Legacy server was "not" [intended](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1009084161098788876/1009084972600152084/unknown.png)

> What do you mean not wanted in anyway if you hate WL you shouldnt even talk about that in public chat

They were also saying i was stealing their discord logo

> LOL WHAT (Dont have footage no more cuz i am banned from their discord)

Around the name change one of waddle legacy/newcpi moderator called "Cookie/Miles Tails Prowler (Yes thats their name on discord) was snitching the wpi discord after i found out, demoted them instantly. Got pissed and left.

July 29th 2022 i gave ownership to someone else and they go by the name Ashley, for that day she owns and develops WL. [PROOF](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1009084161098788876/1009089755323060304/Screenshot_2022-08-16_15.22.12.png)

It looked to be over... It was not, trust me.. 1 month later the drama esculated!

August 15th 2022 in the evening, i got a ping in the WPI discord server with the following [message](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/842511743220580432/1008999031550259210/unknown.png) then got banned from the server.

#### I can confirm Cchris's alt is RosÃ© [proof](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1009084161098788876/1009093318396870666/unknown.png)

> "Waddle Legacy Clown Thing" lol whatðŸ’€ (This was in the public chat AGAIN, very unprofessional. And also Club Penguin and Club Penguin Island are for kids and i know some server are 13+ but some are still meant for kids, why are you promoting swearing in a family friendly server?)

They were still thinking i was the owner of Waddle Legacy wich i am not anymore since July 29th 2022.
Later on Boo0 found out, boo0 is a admin on wpi and the owner of [cpatake](https://cpatake.net/) and saw that they wanted to announce the drama on their social media and wanted to lawsuit me ðŸ’€ [proof](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1009084161098788876/1009091313452470343/Screenshot_2022-08-16_at_11.02.48.png)
When Boo0 saw this he said to me" I just snapped and went on a massive rant" [proof 1](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1009084161098788876/1009091314006106112/Screenshot_2022-08-16_at_10.44.11_1.png) | [proof 2](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1009084161098788876/1009091313704124527/Screenshot_2022-08-16_at_10.45.29_1.png) 

Thats all for now, if the drama continues i will update this.
